# Classy Class-Based Views

Classy Class-Based Views is an alternative way of browsing Django's class-based views, with all the methods and attributes of each class shown, including those inherited from parents.

It shows all the methods on a class in the order that they are resolved by Python, which is a great way to understand how class-based views work.

This site is open source. You can find the [source code for the site on GitHub](https://github.com/brack3t/ccbv/). The data is taken from the Django source code using a [set of inspection tools](https://github.com/brack3t/django-inspectional-tools) which are also open source. You can [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Classy%20Class-Based%20Views%20-%20http%3A//ccbv.co.uk%20by%20%40brsr) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brsr).
