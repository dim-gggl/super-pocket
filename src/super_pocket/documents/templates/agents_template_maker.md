You will be creating a template for an AGENTS.md file that can be used as a starting point for any new project in Cursor IDE. This template should provide a comprehensive framework for defining AI agents that will assist with the specific project.

Here is the project type:
<project_type>
  {{PROJECT_TYPE}}
</project_type>

Here is the project description:
<project_description>
  {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
</project_description>

Your task is to generate a well-structured AGENTS.md template that includes:

1. **Project Overview Section**: A brief description area where the user can describe their project and its main objectives

2. **Agent Definitions**: Templates for different types of agents that would be useful for this type of project, including:
   - A primary development agent for coding tasks
   - A code review agent for quality assurance
   - A documentation agent for maintaining project docs
   - Any project-type-specific agents (e.g., testing agents for web apps, data analysis agents for ML projects)

3. **Agent Structure**: Each agent template should include:
   - Agent name and role
   - Primary responsibilities
   - Key instructions and guidelines
   - Relevant context about the project type and tech stack
   - Specific do's and don'ts
   - Example prompts or use cases

4. **Cursor-Specific Features**: Instructions on how to leverage Cursor's capabilities like:
   - Codebase awareness
   - File context
   - Multi-file editing
   - Terminal integration

5. **Customization Guidelines**: Clear instructions on how to adapt the template for specific project needs

The template should be written in Markdown format and include placeholder sections that can be easily customized. Make the agent definitions specific enough to be useful but general enough to be adaptable. Include comments or instructions within the template to guide users on how to customize it.

Focus on creating agents that will genuinely improve development workflow and code quality for the specified project type. Consider the common challenges and tasks associated with this type of project when designing the agent roles.

Write your complete AGENTS.md template inside <template> tags.
